# Digit_Recognizer
Developing Neural Networks is an important step in the the process of building models which solve real life problems just the way humans do. Understanding the basic ground up coding of the neural network to use Pytorch or Tensorflow more effectively is necessary. This module consists of a neural network which is trained to identify the digit which is handwritten and its image has n=been fed to it. This module uses the basic python libraries- numpy, pandas and matplotlib to read, train and predict using the model.
## Install the basic dependencies:
`pip install numpy`

`pip install pandas`

`pip install matplotlib`

## Use the dataset from kaggle
The dataset used has been attached as azip file: train.zip.
